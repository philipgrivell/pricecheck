## Price Basket Application

Run as

```PriceBasketApplication item1 item2 ... itemn```

e.g.

```PriceBasketApplication Apples Apples Milk Bread```

### Limitations
Price Basket does not deal with multiple linked discounts, i.e. buy 4 soups and get 2 loafs half price, instead the discount calculator will price an unlimited number of loafs half price with the purchase of 2 soups. This will be resolved in later versions,
